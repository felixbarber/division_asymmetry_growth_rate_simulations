# division_asymmetry_growth_rate_simulations
This is a set of simulations required to generate the results presented in the paper "Modeling the impact of single-cell stochasticity, division asymmetry and size control on the population growth rate"

Each set of paper figures is generated by a different set of scripts, corresponding to an individual folder in this repository. Each folder contains necessary files to run these scripts on a computational cluster that employs the SLURM task management system.

The code required to run the individual simulations is contained in the files "growth_simulations.py" within each folder. The settings for each set of scripts are contained within the "simulation_caller.py" files. Once complete, the output data is plotted using the jupyter notebook files contained within each folder.

The mathematica notebooks contain the calculations required to derive key results from the text, including Equation 5 and the relation for the number imbalance between mothers and daughters in a growing population.
